# SP1-science-museum

Community Science Museum Project
Design an engaging, informative, and user-friendly website for a new interactive science museum that is opening in your city.

Brief
An interactive science museum called "Community Science Museum" is about to open in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and secondary school students (7-15 years old) and families with young children. The website should be informative and engaging to encourage visitors to visit the museum. It should also have a responsive design and be easy to operate on a variety of devices. Peer/teacher review is recommended.
You have been provided with resources such as text and images (see links under "Resources"). You must decide how to use these resources in terms of presentation, hierarchy, and design. If any resource is too large, remember to optimize the file size to ensure smooth loading and a perfect user experience. You can choose to do this alone or in a team of two.

Objectives
Apply and integrate acquired skills to demonstrate how to complete large projects independently or in collaboration with others.
Be able to develop static websites based on HTML and CSS.

Learning Outcomes
At the end of this project, you will demonstrate the following:
Design and develop simple web solutions independently or as part of an interdisciplinary team.
Master industry-relevant tools, techniques and expressions, and follow common design specifications and guidelines for website design and development.
Have a deep understanding of the relevant regulations and quality requirements for delivering and presenting their own products. Be able to study and document their own workflow and identify design-related issues and measures that need to be implemented.

Requirements

Plan your project using a project planning board (we recommend using a Github project)

The design of the website must appeal to the target audience.
A personal website should contain at least 4-6 pages, while a two-person team website should contain at least 6 pages.
Composition principles, typography, and color schemes must be considered.
The HTML code should be semantically clear and neatly formatted.
External CSS stylesheets should follow the DRY principle.
The website should load quickly, with a maximum image size of 200 kb.
WCAG principles must be applied to hierarchy, navigation, and use of color.
The website must be responsive, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly across devices.
Search engine optimization (SE) practices such as meta tags and alt text must be implemented.
Using the template provided, write a report discussing what went well and what did not go well during development.
